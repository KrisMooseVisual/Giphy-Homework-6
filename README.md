# Giphy-Homework-6
DANCE DANCE DANCE!

I am creating an array of dance styles as the buttons to generate via Giphy API. 

"What's Your Dance?" is the question presented. next to that will be a form box. 

Fill in the box and submit, which will generate a new button. 

When 'enter' is pressed, or 'Submit Dance' is clicked, a new button will generate. 

Click on any of the buttons available and 10 .gif files should show up on the page.

Next step is to create an on.("click") to stop the animation depending on which .gif file is clicked on. When clicked, the animation will stop.
